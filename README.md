<h1 align="center">How to Deploy Legacy Documentation with MkDocs üëã</h1>
<p>This guide will show you how to convert markdown files to an HTML page and deploy old documentation with MkDocs.</p>

## Motivation

As the homepage has changed and only the latest version (e.g. TypeORM v0.3) is available on typeorm.com, it can be useful to deploy old documentation for reference.

## Usage

### ‚ú® [Demo](https://typeorm-0238.vercel.app/)

To deploy the markdown docs from the typeorm/typeorm repository on GitHub to Vercel, follow these steps:

1. Clone the `typeorm/typeorm` repository using the `npx degit` command.

```sh
mkdir typeorm
cd typeorm
npx degit typeorm/typeorm#0.2.38
```

This will create a new directory called typeorm in your current directory. The directory will contain the source code for the TypeORM project, including the `docs` folder.

2. Install `mkdocs`

```sh
pip install mkdocs
```

3. Setup theme for document page

Create a `mkdocs.yml` with below configuration

```yml
site_name: TypeORM v0.2.38
site_url: https://typeorm-legacy.productsway.com/
theme: readthedocs
```

Then run

```sh
mkdocs build
npx vercel site
```

This will build a document site and deploy the markdown docs to Vercel, creating a live URL for you.

Here is an example of the output of the `vercel deploy` command:

```
Deployment complete!

Your project is now live at:

https://your-project-name.vercel.app/
```

Once the docs have been deployed, you can view them at the URL that was provided.
